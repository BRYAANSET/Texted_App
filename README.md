Texted_Project

Welcome to my first Android app! 
In this project I have created a contact book using the Firebase platform to store contact data.

App Features

- The app allows the user to add, edit and delete contacts.
- Contact data is stored in a real-time Firebase database.
- Users can authenticate using their Google credentials.
